## ✨ About Me

I professionally make websites *prettier*, *sassier*, and spend way too much time in Inspect Mode making sure everything is pixel-perfect.

You’ll usually find me:
- Cramming projects with questionable amounts of coffee ☕  
- Overthinking every pixel, font size, and shadow  
- Turning normal buttons into ✨sparkly, hoverable dopamine traps✨  
- Whispering sweet nothings to my media queries

## 🛠️ My Code Arsenal

> *“It’s not a bug, it’s an aesthetic challenge.”*

**Languages & Tools:**

`HTML` • `CSS` • `JavaScript` • `PHP (send help)`  
`Bootstrap` • `MySQL` • `Leaflet` • `Figma (aka pixel panic simulator)`

**Bonus Abilities:**
- ✔ Obsessing over tiny alignment issues 
- ✔ Fixing little design things no one notices… but I do  
- ✔ Smashing `Ctrl + S` every 3 seconds for peace of mind

## 🔥 Current Experiments

- 🖥️ **MVC Projects** — Learning to organize my chaos with proper architecture  
- 🗄️ **Backend Basics** — Making servers and databases behave (most of the time)  
- 🗺️ **Map Web Apps with Leaflet** — Plotting points and preventing people from getting lost 
- 🎀 **Bento Layout Overkill** — Grids. Everywhere. No regrets

## 🎯 Life Goals

- Make the internet 75% cuter — preferably with lots of purple 💜  
- Add hover states *just because*  
- Master the sacred art of *“Looks good on mobile AND desktop”*  
- Keep breaking stuff until it’s pretty *and* functional
