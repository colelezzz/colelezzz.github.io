					<h2>meet <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #FF4081;">Blossom</span></h2>
					<p>Blossom (voiced by Cathy Cavadini) is one of the main characters in the animated television
						series "Powerpuff Girls."</p>

					<p>She has long, light red-orange hair, pink eyes, and usually wears a pink dress with a black belt
						and a red bow on the top of her head and a heart-shaped hairclip when seen from behind. She is
						known for being the smartest one and the leader of the Powerpuff Girls.</p>

					<p>She often tries to play peacemaker between her two sisters if they yell at each other (she and
						Buttercup often yell typically).</p>

					<p>Her special superpower is "Ice Breath," similar to Ace`s cryokinesis power in "Power Lunch", as
						revealed in the episode "Ice Sore," though in the same episode she has been shown to breathe
						fire. In "Ice Sore," surprised and shocked by her new power, Bubbles and Buttercup quickly
						become very jealous of their sister. During the episode Power-Noia, it's revealed that she
						dislikes failing tests.</p>

					<h2>meet <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #61d1fa;">Bubbles</span></h2>
					<p>Bubbles (voiced by Tara Strong in the series) is one of the main characters in the animated
						television series "Powerpuff Girls."</p>

					<p>She is portrayed as having blonde hair in two pigtails, blue eyes, and dresses in a blue dress
						with
						a black belt. She is the strongest of the group (despite being the same age as her sisters) and
						is
						defined by being the cutest. She does, however, have a tendency to be the toughest, leading to
						her
						never being regarded, by friends and foes alike, as the group's strongest link, a fact that has
						led
						to her never being manipulated by opponents.</p>

					<p>She can be very independent when pushed, and out of all the Powerpuff Girls, she is the most
						feared
						by Mojo Jojo after having single-handedly taken him down in a fit of rage in the episode
						Bubblevicious.</p>

					<p>Her special superpower is the Sonic Scream (although later the other Powerpuff Girls seem to be
						able
						to use their own version too).</p>

					<p>She is afraid of the dark, which is often the focus and revealed on some episodes (such as
						"Boogie
						Frights" and "Power-Noia").</p>

					<h2>meet <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #66B032;">Buttercup</span></h2>
					<p>Buttercup (voiced by Elizabeth Daily) is one of the main characters in The Powerpuff Girls.</p>

					<p>Buttercup is the most aggressive and cynical of the Powerpuff Girls. Unlike Blossom, who is
						level-headed and smart, and Bubbles, who is emotional and bubbly, Buttercup has a more
						rebellious and tough demeanor. She is known for being bossy, vain, and demanding, and she often
						expresses her dislike for things like unicorns and chores. Buttercup can be physically and
						emotionally intense, sometimes hurting others to get her way, and she rarely smiles—when she
						does, it’s said to disrupt reality.</p>

					<p>Despite her harsh exterior, Buttercup still deeply cares for her sisters, Blossom and Bubbles,
						even if she often orders them around. She’s recognized as the fighter of the group, wearing a
						light green dress with a black belt and having short black hair. Her special abilities include
						curling her tongue and flying slightly faster than her sisters. She also has a softer, more
						vulnerable side, shown in episodes like “Cover Up,” where she clings to a green blanket for
						confidence, and “Moral Decay,” where she struggles with doing the right thing. Though she’s
						naturally combative and resistant to authority, she ultimately shows deep loyalty and
						protectiveness toward her family.</p>

					<h2>meet <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ffd930;">Professor Utonium</span></h2>
					<p>Professor Utonium (voiced by Tom Kane) is the scientist responsible for creating the Powerpuff
						Girls.</p>

					<p>The Professor is very "square," and he is unlucky in love (which perhaps explains why he created
						the girls through science; however there was once a possible hint of him being married but
						somehow that ended in tragedy, possibly death as proved by a second pillow in the Professor's
						bed). He is protective of the girls, sometimes to a fault. In the episode "Knock It Off" it is
						revealed that his first name is Antonio.</p>

					<p>He is a very affectionate and supportive father whose pep talks often bring the girls around
						when they are discouraged. While he is sometimes portrayed as rather skittish, he can be firm
						with the girls when he needs to (particularly when they get into physical fights or arguments).
					</p>

					<p>He is a keen golfer and some of his most successful inventions are those that he makes by
						accident - such as the Powerpuff Girls themselves, or the containment device seen in "Bubble
						Boy" (he says of it: "Once again, I have no idea what I did!"). He bears a slight resemblance to
						Samurai Jack.</p>

					<h2>meet <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #6A4C9C;">Mojo Jojo</span></h2>
					<p>Mojo Jojo (voiced by Roger L. Jackson):</p>

					<p>This is the main antagonist of the series.A monkey with great intelligence, notable for his bad,
						pseudo-Japanese accent and his overly convoluted manner of speaking. As revealed in the episode
						"Mr. Mojo's Rising," and again in The Powerpuff Girls Movie, Mojo Jojo was Professor Utonium's
						lab assistant, Jojo, before Professor Utonium created the Powerpuff Girls, and it was he who
						caused the Professor to accidentally add Chemical X to the mixture (thus making him responsible
						for their creation in the first place).</p>

					<p>He is the Powerpuff Girls' most frequent villain. He has a huge, exposed brain under his hat,
						and has no super strength; however, as seen in the episode "Forced Kin" (a chimpanzee is, in
						fact, about four times as strong as an adult male human, so perhaps it represents an enhancement
						of his latent natural talent). While he is portrayed as serious and arrogant, he is often used
						to make humorously long speeches or sarcastic statements. He has even sometimes shown a slightly
						friendly attitude toward the girls, most notably when he babysits them in one episode. He is
						also slightly scared of them, particularly Bubbles. His most frequent utterance is,
						"Mo-Jo-Jojo!" Saying Mojo slowly and quicker on Jojo. When Bubbles became Mojo-esque in one
						episode, she too said it like this.</p>
